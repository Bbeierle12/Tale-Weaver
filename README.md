# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.
To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app is served on port 9002 by default.

## Building

Create a production build with:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the built server using:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Testing

Execute the Jest test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

## Useful npm scripts

Aside from `dev`, `build`, and `start`, the project exposes additional scripts in `package.json`:

- `genkit:dev` – launch Genkit in development mode.
- `genkit:watch` – start Genkit with watch enabled.
- `lint` – run ESLint checks.
- `typecheck` – run the TypeScript compiler without emitting files.
- `test` – run unit tests.
- `stress` – execute stress benchmarks in `bench/stress.ts`.

Consult `package.json` for the full list and details.
