# Lineage Fitness

Every lineage tracks cumulative member ticks as a proxy for fitness. CSV files:

- `lineage.csv` – histogram of trait means and membership counts at each interval.
- `lineageFitness.csv` – final ranking by cumulative fitness.

Use `benchmarks/lineageReport.ts` to print summaries.
